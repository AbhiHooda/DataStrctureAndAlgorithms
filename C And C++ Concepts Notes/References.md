References
	References is a c++ concept. References in c++ is used to give an alias name to a variale. So basically to names are given to the variable.

	e.g

	#include<iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		int a = 10;
		int &ref = a; // A reference must be initilized at the point of declaration.
	}

A reference is primarly used in parameter passing.
